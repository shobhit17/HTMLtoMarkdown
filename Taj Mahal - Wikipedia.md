The**Taj Mahal**tdÊ’mhl, more oftent[[3]](#cite_note-3)meaning Crown of the Palace[[4]](#cite_note-Ahmed1998-4)) is an ivory\-white marble[mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum)on the south bank of the[Yamuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna)river in the Indian city of[Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra)\. It was commissioned in 1632 by the[Mughal emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire)[Shah Jahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan)(reigned 1628â€“1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife,[Mumtaz Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumtaz_Mahal)\. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17\-hectare (42\-acre)[[5]](#cite_note-5)complex, which includes a[mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque)and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a[crenellated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crenellated)wall\.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but 
work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years\. The 
Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 
1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million[rupees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee), which in 2015 would be approximately 52\.8 billion rupees ([US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar)827 million)\.
 The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the 
guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the 
emperor,[Ustad Ahmad Lahauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ustad_Ahmad_Lahauri)

The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO[World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site)in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the 
universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage"\. Described by 
Nobel laureate[Rabindranath Tagore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore)as "the tear\-drop on the cheek of time",[[6]](#cite_note-6)[[7]](#cite_note-pbstreasures-7)it is regarded by many as the best example of[Mughal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_architecture)and a symbol of India's rich history\. The Taj Mahal attracts 7â€“8 
million visitors a year\. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the[New7Wonders of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_the_World)(2000â€“2007) initiative\.

## Inspiration
The Taj Mahal was commissioned by[Shah Jahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Jahan)in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife[Mumtaz Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumtaz_Mahal), a[Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people)princess who died giving birth to their 14th child,[Gauhara Begum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauhara_Begum)[[7]](#cite_note-pbstreasures-7)Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632\.[[8]](#cite_note-:0-8)The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of[Mumtaz Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumtaz_Mahal)illustrate the love story held as the inspiration for Taj Mahal\.[[9]](#cite_note-9)[[10]](#cite_note-10)The principal mausoleum was completed in 1643[[8]](#cite_note-:0-8)and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished about five years later\._citation needed_

## Architecture and designMain article:[Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_and_architecture_of_the_Taj_Mahal)
The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of[Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_architecture)and earlier[Mughal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_architecture)\. Specific inspiration came from successful[Timurid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_dynasty)and Mughal buildings including the[Gur\-e Amir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gur-e_Amir)(the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in[Samarkand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand)[[11]](#cite_note-11)[Humayun's Tomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humayun%27s_Tomb)[Itmad\-Ud\-Daulah's Tomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itmad-Ud-Daulah%27s_Tomb)(sometimes called the_Baby Taj_), and Shah Jahan's own[Jama Masjid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jama_Masjid,_Delhi)in[Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi)\. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red[sandstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone), Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with[semi\-precious stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-precious_stones)\. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement\.[[12]](#cite_note-12)

### Tomb
The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal\.
 It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square[plinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plinth)and consists of a symmetrical building with an_[iwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwan)_(an arch\-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and[finial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finial)\. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin\.[[13]](#cite_note-13)

The base structure is a large multi\-chambered cube with[chamfered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer)corners forming an unequal eight\-sided structure that is approximately 
55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides\. Each side of the
 iwan is framed with a huge_[pishtaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pishtaq)_or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side\. This motif of stacked_pishtaqs_is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design 
completely symmetrical on all sides of the building\. Four minarets frame
 the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered 
corners\. The main chamber houses the false[sarcophagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcophagi)of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level\.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

| Main marble dome, smaller domes, and decorative spires that extend from the edges of the base walls\. 
The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the 
tomb\. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in 
measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the 
cylindrical "drum" it sits on which is approximately 7 metres 
(23 ft) high\. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an[onion dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_dome)or_amrud_(guava dome)\.[[15]](#cite_note-15)The top is decorated with a[lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo_nucifera)design which also serves to accentuate its height\. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed_[chattris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhatri)_(kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome\. The dome is slightly asymmetrical\.[[16]](#cite_note-16)Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior\. Tall decorative spires (_guldastas_) extend from edges of base walls, and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome\. The[lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo_nucifera)motif is repeated on both the_chattris_and_guldastas_\. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded[finial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finial)which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements\.

The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded[bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze)in the early 19th century\. This feature provides a clear example of 
integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements\.[[17]](#cite_note-17)The finial is topped by a[moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon), a typical[Islamic motif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent#Pre-Islamic_and_Islamic_uses)whose horns point[heavenward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven)[[18]](#cite_note-Tillitson.2C_G.H.R._1990-18)

The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, 
display the designer's penchant for symmetry\. They were designed as 
working minaretsâ€”a traditional element of mosques, used by the[muezzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muezzin)to call the Islamic faithful to prayer\. Each minaret is effectively 
divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the 
tower\. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a[chattri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattri)that mirrors the design of those on the tomb\. The chattris all share 
the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded 
finial\. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so 
that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall 
constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to 
fall away from the tomb\.

### Exterior decorations
The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in 
Mughal architecture\. As the surface area changes, the decorations are 
refined proportionally\. The decorative elements were created by applying
 paint,[stucco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stucco),
 stone inlays or carvings\. In line with the Islamic prohibition against 
the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped
 into either[calligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calligraphy), abstract forms or vegetative motifs\. Throughout the complex are[passages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura)from the[Qur'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an)that comprise some of the decorative elements\. Recent scholarship suggests that the passages were chosen by Amanat Khan\.[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-k100-20)

The calligraphy on the Great Gate reads_"O Soul, thou art at rest\. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you\."_[[20]](#cite_note-k100-20)The calligraphy was created in 1609 by a calligrapher named[Abdul Haq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Haq)\. Shah Jahan conferred the title of "Amanat Khan" upon him as a reward for his "dazzling virtuosity"\.[[21]](#cite_note-IAAO-21)Near the lines from the Qur'an at the base of the interior dome is the 
inscription, "Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi\."[[22]](#cite_note-22)Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid[thuluth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuluth)script made of[jasper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper)or black marble[[21]](#cite_note-IAAO-21)inlaid in white marble panels\. Higher panels are written in slightly 
larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below\. The 
calligraphy found on the marble[cenotaphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph)in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate\.

Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, 
minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the 
surfaces of the tomb\. The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings 
are worked with[tracery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracery)of[incised painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incised_painting)to create elaborate geometric forms\.[Herringbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_spicatum)inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements\. White 
inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the 
white marbles\. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained 
or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of 
geometric patterns\. Floors and walkways use contrasting[tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile)or blocks in[tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation)patterns\.

On the lower walls of the tomb are white marble[dados](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dado_%28architecture%29)sculpted with realistic[bas relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_relief)depictions of flowers and vines\. The marble has been polished to 
emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings\. The dado frames and 
archway[spandrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel)have been decorated with[pietra dura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietra_dura)inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits\. 
The inlay stones are of yellow marble, jasper and jade, polished and 
levelled to the surface of the walls\.[[21]](#cite_note-IAAO-21)

| Calligraphy on the walls\. 
#### Interior decoration
The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional 
decorative elements\. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a[lapidary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapidary)of precious and semiprecious[gemstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone)[[23]](#cite_note-23)The inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from
 each face, although only the door facing the garden to the south is 
used\. The interior walls are about 25 metres (82 ft) high and are 
topped by a "false" interior dome decorated with a sun motif\. Eight 
pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and, as with the 
exterior, each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway
 up the wall\.[[24]](#cite_note-GWW-24)The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate screen or_[jali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jali)_cut from marble\. In addition to the light from the balcony screens, 
light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners\. 
The octagonal marble screen or_jali_bordering the cenotaphs is 
made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work\.
 The remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi\-precious
 stones forming twining vines, fruits and flowers\. Each chamber wall is 
highly decorated with dado bas\-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and 
refined calligraphy panels which reflect, in miniature detail, the 
design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex\.[[25]](#cite_note-25)

| Detail of_jali_\. 
Muslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves\. Hence, the 
bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt 
beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards[Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca)\. Mumtaz Mahal's[cenotaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph)is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular 
marble base of 1\.5 by 2\.5 metres (4 ft 11 in by 8 ft 
2 in)\. Both the base and[casket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casket)are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems\. 
Calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise Mumtaz\. On 
the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a
 writing tablet\. Shah Jahan's cenotaph is beside Mumtaz's to the western
 side, and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex\.
 His cenotaph is bigger than his wife's, but reflects the same elements:
 a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with 
lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him\. On the lid of the casket 
is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box\.[[24]](#cite_note-GWW-24)

The pen box and writing tablet are traditional Mughal[funerary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funerary)icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively\.[The Ninety Nine Names of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_the_Qur%27an)are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of Mumtaz Mahal\. Other inscriptions inside the crypt include,_"O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious\.\.\. "_\.
 The tomb of Shah Jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads; "He
 travelled from this world to the banquet\-hall of Eternity on the night 
of the twenty\-sixth of the month of[Rajab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajab), in the year 1076[Hijri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar)[[26]](#cite_note-26)

### Garden![Image](Taj%20Mahal%20-%20Wikipedia_files/220px-Taj_Mahal_5.jfif)Walkways beside reflecting pool
The complex is set around a large 300\-metre (980 ft) square_[charbagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charbagh)_or[Mughal garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_gardens)\. The garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into 16 sunken[parterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parterre)or flowerbeds\. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a[reflecting pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflecting_pool)positioned on a north\-south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum\. The raised marble water tank is called_al Hawd al\-Kawthar_in reference to the "Tank of Abundance" promised to[Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad)[[27]](#cite_note-Begley-27)

Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees and[fountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain)\. The[charbagh garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charbagh_garden), a design inspired by[Persian gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_gardens), was introduced to India by[Babur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babur), the first Mughal emperor\. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of[Jannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannah)(Paradise) and reflects the[Paradise garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_garden)derived from the Persian_paridaeza_, meaning 'walled garden'\. In[mystic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_mysticism)Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal 
garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or 
mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east\.

Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or[pavilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavilion)in the centre\. The Taj Mahal garden is unusual in that the main 
element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden\. With the 
discovery of[Mahtab Bagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahtab_Bagh)or "Moonlight Garden" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the[Archaeological Survey of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_Survey_of_India)is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's 
design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise\.[[28]](#cite_note-28)Similarities in layout and architectural features with[the Shalimar Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalimar_Gardens_%28Jammu_and_Kashmir%29)suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan\.[[29]](#cite_note-29)Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant[roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose)[daffodils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffodil), and[fruit trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_tree)[[30]](#cite_note-30)As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj Mahal and its gardens also declined\. By the end of the 19th century, the[British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire)controlled more than three\-fifths of India,[[31]](#cite_note-Royals-31)and assumed management of the Taj Mahal\. They changed the landscaping 
to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London\.[[32]](#cite_note-Koch.2C_p._139-32)

### Outlying buildings![Image](Taj%20Mahal%20-%20Wikipedia_files/220px-Taj_12.jfif)The Great gate (Darwaza\-i rauza) is the main entrance to the tomb\.
The Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by[crenellated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crenellation)red sandstone walls; the side facing the river is open\. Outside the 
walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah Jahan's
 other[wives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives), and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant\.[[33]](#cite_note-33)

The main gateway (_darwaza_) is a monumental structure built 
primarily of marble, and reminiscent of the Mughal architecture of 
earlier emperors\. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways, 
and its_pishtaq_arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates
 the tomb\. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric 
designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the 
complex\.[[34]](#cite_note-34)

At the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings 
that mirror each other, and face the sides of the tomb\. The backs of the
 buildings parallel the western and eastern walls\. The western building 
is a mosque and the other is the_jawab_(answer), thought to have 
been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been 
used as a guesthouse\. Distinctions between the two buildings include the_jawab's_lack of a_[mihrab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihrab)_(a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and its floors of geometric 
design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 
prayer rugs in black marble\. The mosque's basic design of a long hall 
surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by Shah Jahan, 
particularly the_Masjid\-i JahÄ?n\-NumÄ?_, or[Jama Masjid, Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jama_Masjid,_Delhi)\. The Mughal mosques of this period divide the[sanctuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary)hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller 
sanctuaries on either side\. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto 
an expansive vaulting dome\. The outlying buildings were completed in 
1643\._citation needed_

## Construction
The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled
 city of Agra\. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large 
palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land\.[[35]](#cite_note-35)An area of roughly 1\.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with 
dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above 
riverbank\. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and 
rubble to form the[footings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_%28engineering%29)of the tomb\. Instead of lashed[bamboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo),
 workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb\. 
The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years 
to dismantle\.[[36]](#cite_note-36)

The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and
 Asia\. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport 
building materials\. The translucent white marble was brought from[Makrana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makrana), Rajasthan, the jasper from[Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_region)[jade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade)and[crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal)from China\. The[turquoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquoise)was from[Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet)and the[Lapis lazuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli)from[Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan), while the[sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire)came from[Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka)and the[carnelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnelian)from[Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia)\. In all, twenty\-eight types of precious and semi\-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble\.

According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep 
the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by 
peasants overnight\. A 15\-kilometre (9\.3 mi) tamped\-earth ramp was 
built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and 
teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially 
constructed wagons\.[[37]](#cite_note-CarrollDivision1973-37)An elaborate[post\-and\-beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-and-beam)pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position\. Water was drawn from the river by a series of_purs_,
 an animal\-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank 
and raised to a large distribution tank\. It was passed into three 
subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex\.

The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete\. The remaining 
parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in 
order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway\. Since the complex was 
built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to 
differing opinions on "completion"\. Construction of the mausoleum itself
 was essentially completed by 1643[[8]](#cite_note-:0-8)while work continued on the outlying buildings\. Estimates of the cost 
of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across 
time\. The total cost has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian 
rupees,[[8]](#cite_note-:0-8)which is around 52\.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 values\.[[38]](#cite_note-38)

## Later days
Abdul Hamid Lahauri in his book_[Badshahnama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badshahnama)_refers to Taj Mahal as_[rauza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauza)\-i munawwara_, meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb\.[[39]](#cite_note-39)Soon after the Taj Mahal's completion, Shah Jahan was deposed by his son[Aurangzeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb)and put under house arrest at nearby[Agra Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra_Fort)\. Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife\.[[40]](#cite_note-40)In the 18th century, the[Jat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat)rulers of[Bharatpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatpur_State)invaded Agra and attacked the Taj Mahal, the two chandeliers, one of 
agate and another of silver, which were hung over the main cenotaph, 
were taken away by them, along with the gold and silver screen\. Kanbo, a
 Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4\.6\-metre\-high
 (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during
 the Jat despoliation\.[[41]](#cite_note-41)

By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair\. During the time of the[Indian rebellion of 1857](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rebellion_of_1857), the Taj Mahal was defaced by British soldiers and government officials, who chiselled out precious stones and[lapis lazuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli)from its walls\. At the end of the 19th century, British[viceroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy)[Lord Curzon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Nathaniel_Curzon,_1st_Marquess_Curzon_of_Kedleston)ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908\.[[42]](#cite_note-42)[[43]](#cite_note-43)He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber, modelled after one in a[Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo)mosque\. During this time the garden was remodelled with British\-style lawns that are still in place today\.[[32]](#cite_note-Koch.2C_p._139-32)

## Threats![Image](Taj%20Mahal%20-%20Wikipedia_files/220px-Taj_protective_scaffold.jfif)Protective wartime scaffolding
In 1942, the government erected a scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the[Japanese Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Air_Service)[[44]](#cite_note-44)[[45]](#cite_note-45)During the[India\-Pakistan wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India-Pakistan_wars)of 1965 and 1971,[scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffolding)were again erected to mislead bomber pilots\.[[46]](#cite_note-46)

More recent threats have come from[environmental pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_pollution)on the banks of the[Yamuna River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna_River)including[acid rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain)[[47]](#cite_note-47)due to the[Mathura Oil Refinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura_Refinery)[[48]](#cite_note-48)which was opposed by[Supreme Court of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India)directives\.[[49]](#cite_note-49)The pollution has been turning the Taj Mahal yellow\. To help control 
the pollution, the Indian government has set up the Taj Trapezium Zone 
(TTZ), a 10,400\-square\-kilometre (4,000 sq mi) area around the
 monument where strict emissions standards are in place\.[[50]](#cite_note-50)

Concerns for the tomb's structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the[Yamuna river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna_river)basin which is falling at a rate of around 1\.5 m (5 ft) per 
year\. In 2010, cracks appeared in parts of the tomb, and the minarets 
which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting, as the wooden
 foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water\. Although it
 has been pointed out by politicians, that the minarets are designed to 
tilt slightly outwards, to prevent them crashing on top of the tomb in 
the event of an earthquake\. In 2011, it was reported that some 
predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within 5 years\.[[51]](#cite_note-51)[[52]](#cite_note-52)

## Tourism![Image](Taj%20Mahal%20-%20Wikipedia_files/220px-GroupFromNorthEastIndiaAtTaj.jfif)Visitors at Taj Mahal
The Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists\. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[[53]](#cite_note-53)which had increased to about 7â€“8 million in 2014\.[[2]](#cite_note-indiatimes-2)A two\-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower 
entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for 
foreigners\. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, 
November and February\. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex
 and tourists must either walk from parking lots or catch an electric 
bus\. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored
 for use as a new visitor centre\.[[54]](#cite_note-54)[[55]](#cite_note-k254-55)

The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was originally constructed with[caravanserais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravanserais)[bazaars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar)and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workmen\.[[56]](#cite_note-K201-208-56)Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of[seven wonders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_World)of the modern world, including the recently announced[New Seven Wonders of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Seven_Wonders_of_the_World), a recent poll with 100 million votes\.[[57]](#cite_note-57)

The grounds are open from 06:00 to 19:00 weekdays, except for Friday 
when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between 12:00 and 
14:00\. The complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon
 and two days before and after,[[58]](#cite_note-58)excluding Fridays and the month of[Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan)\. For security reasons[[59]](#cite_note-59)only five itemsâ€”water in transparent bottles, small video cameras, 
still cameras, mobile phones and small ladies' pursesâ€”are allowed inside
 the Taj Mahal\.[[60]](#cite_note-60)

## Myths![Image](Taj%20Mahal%20-%20Wikipedia_files/200px-Jean-Baptiste_Tavernier.jfif)Jean\-Baptiste Tavernier, one of the first European visitors to the Taj Mahal
Ever since its construction, the building has been the source of an 
admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and 
emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of 
the monument\.[[61]](#cite_note-k231-61)A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a[mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mausoleum)to be built in black marble as a[Black Taj Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Taj_Mahal)across the Yamuna river\.[[62]](#cite_note-A210-62)The idea originates from fanciful writings of[Jean\-Baptiste Tavernier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Tavernier),
 a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665\. It was suggested that 
Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb before it could be built\.
 Ruins of blackened marble across the river in_Moonlight Garden_, 
Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend\. However, excavations carried
 out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had
 turned black\.[[63]](#cite_note-k249-63)A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was 
demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the 
pool in the Moonlight Garden\. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum 
could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry 
and the positioning of the pool itself\.[[64]](#cite_note-64)

No evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific 
detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan 
supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with
 the tomb\. Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed
 contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design\. 
Similar claims are made for many famous buildings\.[[65]](#cite_note-K239-65)No evidence exists for claims that[Lord William Bentinck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_William_Bentinck),
 governor\-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish 
the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble\. Bentinck's biographer John 
Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund\-raising sale of 
discarded marble from Agra Fort\.[[66]](#cite_note-66)

Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will 
cause water to come forth\. To this day, officials find broken[bangles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangle)surrounding the silhouette\.[[67]](#cite_note-k240-67)

In 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed[P\. N\. Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Nagesh_Oak)'s petition[[68]](#cite_note-68)to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal\.[[65]](#cite_note-K239-65)[[69]](#cite_note-The_Hindu.C2.A0.E2.80.93_14_July_2000-69)In 2005 a similar petition was dismissed by the[Allahabad High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad_High_Court)\.
 This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher
 who says that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmar Dev in 
1196\.[[70]](#cite_note-70)

A theory that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo 
Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by 
Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work_Itinerario__The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\-1643_)\. Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by[Sleeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Sleeman)based on the work of[Jean\-Baptiste Tavernier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Tavernier)\.
 These idea were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E\.B\. 
Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and 
controversies\.[[71]](#cite_note-71)
